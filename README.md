Given a large tree, too big to display in its entirety, this mock-up allows users to
 
  *  Select a node to be the root of the tree (double-click on text).  Double click on root text to revert to previous root.
  *  Expand all leaf nodes of a selected node at the same time (right click on text)
  *  Use a drop down to select specific types of node
  *  Use an XPath style search text to select specific nodes.  This requires a tutorial in itself, but there is an example in the demo.  The example assumes that "instances" is selected in the drop down.
